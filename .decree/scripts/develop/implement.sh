prompt="You are a senior Go engineer. Read ${DECREE_MESSAGE} and
implement all requirements with proper error handling and tests.
Work in small steps, one requirement at a time, and keep the code building
between steps. After each step, append a line to ${progress}: what is done
and what is next. If ${progress} exists, an earlier attempt was cut short:
check the code against it and continue from there. If ${plan} exists, follow it.
If the message is ambiguous or conflicts with the code, do not guess: write
the question to ${stop} and stop.
Logs of earlier attempts (if any) are in ${DECREE_RUN_DIR}."
